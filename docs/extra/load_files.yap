We assume two different programming styles:





   + Evaluation of <em>deterministic</em> programs often
   boils down to a recursive loop of the form:

   ~~~~~
   loop(Done).
   loop(Env) :-
   do_something(Env,NewEnv),
   loop(NewEnv).
   ~~~~~

   or to the repeat-fail loop:

   ~~~~~
   loop(Inp) :-
   do_something(Inp,Out),
   out_and_fail(Out).
   ~~~~~
